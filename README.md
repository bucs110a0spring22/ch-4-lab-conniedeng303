## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:

To align my code with conventions, I saved every stray number to a variable. For example, the 
By doing this, I am also able to tweak parameters to change how the graph would look,such as only graphing SIN from one specifc degree to another degree.

In terms of updating my code, I updated my SetupAxis function where I created a loop that creates my axis (I also made it shorter than 12 lines of code, a guideline mentioned in the grading guidelines) instead of hardcoding every directional instruction for my turtle.
 

        Summary of function(s) added:

To start off adding an additional function, I wanted to see if I could graph the recipocal of sin, or csc. To do that, I had to import mpmath to use its csc function to graph it. I also decided to fully change the coordinates by doing "wn.setworldcoordinates(-360,-5,360,5)", which zooms out enough where I can see both the trig function graphs AND the csc graph.

 For my return functions, I wanted to see the difference in values between my Sin and Csc values (csc is the recipocal of sin), so I created functions that would return the y values of user inputs
